Q1. Types of Intent – There are 2 types of intent Implicit and Explicit
-- Explicit intent - An intent is explicit when an action uses or calls class/package or component within its own app to satisfy the need.
For example, perform an activity to download a file but action is called within app

-- Implicit Intent – An intent is implicit when an action calls a component from another app or source to handle it.
For example, a user wants to get location and action call google maps to provide need info.
This is normally done using (Intent.ACTION_VIEW) as in line # 69 in SecondFragment.kt:

var intent = Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW)


Q2. Explicit Intent is more secure as the actions are handled within an app.
Since an implicit intent does not specify a particular application to receive the data,
any application can process the intent by using an Intent Filter for that intent.
This can allow untrusted applications to obtain sensitive data, cause privilege escalation or denial-of-service

Q3. The intent in lines 69 to 73 in the file SecondFragment.kt is an Implicit Intent. A URL is used to go thru a https service to get the index of products 
Secondfragment is called by register new user (action/intent) and shows this implicit intent when the user is registered successfully

Q4. In file ThirdFragment.kt lines 68 to 70 an Explicit intent is used by when ProductScrollingActivity class makes a call within the app to get the list of products.
ThirdFragment is called when registered user uses the login screen. The application shows the products list.

Q5. Explicit intent is the proper way to do an Intent as it is more secure. However, sometimes there may be the need to use implicit intents.
In those cases, secure practices must be implemented. As stated above explicit intent are more secure to use. SecondFragment uses implicit
intent to get product list.
Using Right Intent -- By looking at the output and clicking on the link used in SecondFragment, I compared the Products View
(Same screen for Login workflow called in ThirdFragment), I was able to replace the implicit intent with an explicit intent
by calling ProductScrollingActivity class to get the information within the application. The application worked without any issue.
The change was also confirmed with registering new user which landed on Products view, similar to login screen using explicit intent.
